# Balanced Parentheses Exercise
# In this exercise you are going to apply what you learned about stacks with a real world problem. We will be using stacks to make sure the parentheses are balanced in mathematical expressions such as: ((32+8)âˆ—(5/2))/(2+6). In real life you can see this extend to many things such as text editor plugins and interactive development environments for all sorts of bracket completion checks.

# Take a string as an input and return True if it's parentheses are balanced or False if it is not.

# Try to code up a solution and pass the test cases.

            return None
